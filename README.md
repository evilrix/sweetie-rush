sweetie-rush
============

A prototype/concept for a game similar to "Candy Crush".

TODO:

* Currently, there is no scoring mechanism.
* The game is meant to only last for 1 minute.
* New matches generated by "drops" are not handled.
* The randomization of sweeties relies on the CRT, which is pretty poor.
* The game-board code is a little hacky (it's still prototype/work in progress)
* There are almost certainly still dragons in the matching code
* The standard C++ code should be effcient, but the SDL code can probably be improved
* No logic exists to enforce there'll always be a legal move

Requirements:
* Visual Studio 2013 (the code base is C++11 and won't build with older, non-standard versions)
* SDL and SDL Image libraries
* Doxygen if you want to create the API docs (see inline doxygen commentary)

The code is written in ANSI C++ compatible with the C++11 standard. Whilst it was written using Visual Studio 2013, is should, with very few modifications, build and run on any platform using a C++11 complient compiler.
